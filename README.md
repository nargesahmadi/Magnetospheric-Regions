Magnetospheric Region Identifier

This code identifies 6 magnetospheric regions (Solar wind (SW), Foreshock (FS), Magnetosheath (MSH), Magnetosphere (MSP), Plasma sheet (PS) and Lobe (LOBE)) using Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission data. 
The model uses ion omni flux timeseries and plasma parameters (total magnetic field, total ion temperature, and position in X GSE). 

Predictions can be made using predictions.ipynb file by just giving it the desired time range.
